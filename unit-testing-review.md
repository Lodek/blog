## Summary 
The book "Unit Testing Principles, Practices and Patterns" takes a different approach to explaining tests and unit tests.

Right off the bat, the author justifies the importance of tests and their purpose.
With their importance established, the author starts exploring the subject of unit tests from the prespective of a set of attributes that exists in "good" tests.
These attributes are: resistance to refactoring, protection against regression, maintanability and execution speed.

The attributes acts as guiding principles which guide the dicussion about unit testing.
From these discussions the author explores different testing topics and introduces concepts to help in writing effective tests.

Althouh this book is focused on tests, Vladimir writes about applications accounting for common architectural practices.
Several examples in the book assume enterprise applications designed using MVC and DDD.
The beauty of this approach is that the book teaches about code architecture while teaching tests.
It might be no surprise as "good" code is often easier to test but nevertheless, the dicussions about application architecture are excellent and very eye opening.
The author touches on several axis of enterprise applications such as: databases, multi layer architecture, message passing and functional architecture.
The end result is that the discussions are rich, full of context and tons of incredible information.
